# Student-Performance-Regression-Analysis

The data interprets two schools in Portugal and looks at numerous variables which influence student performance in math. We examined how absences (a numerical predictor) affect a studentâ€™s performance in math. Using regression analysis, we tested the significance of categorical predictors, such as failures and traveltime, to see if they influence the final grades of a student.
